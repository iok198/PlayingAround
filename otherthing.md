# Other stuff

This is some other stuff that you can do

### You can do stuff like

- Look at this knowing you **have no life**
- Or look at this since you are *probably bored* 

If you want, you can go [here](javascript:setInterval(() => alert("FOOL!"), 0))

And here is some javascript code

```javascript
var constants = {
    get life() {
        return 42
    }

    set life(value) {
        console.log("YOU CANNO'T CHANGE LIFE!")
    }
}
```
